# Captive Portal

## Introduction

This django application writen by [Masoud Sadri](https://github.com/msadri70) years ago does management on internet.
In the first generation of the system this captive portal provides APIs for gathering
user information which was moved into [internet](https://github.com/aut-cic/internet) after a few months so those APIs
are useless now.
